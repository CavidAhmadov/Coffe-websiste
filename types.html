     <p>   Espresso /       A strong concentrated coffee drink typically served in a small espresso cup. It is commonly used as a base for many coffee drinks such as lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos.
        Espresso is a delicious concentrated form of coffee, served in shots. It's often the coffee base of many other beverages, such as cappuccino, latte, americano and macchiato. An espresso is intense and bold, but nonetheless delicious, and usually served in small demitasse-style cups for this reason.

  <p>Ristretto  is a "short shot"  of a more highly concentrated espresso coffee. It is made with the same amount of ground coffee, but extracted with a finer grind (also in from 20 to 30 seconds) using half as much water. A normal short shot might look like a ristretto, but in reality, would only be a weaker, more diluted, shot. The opposite of a ristretto (Italian for 'shortened', 'narrow') is a lungo ('long'), which has double the amount of water. The French call a ristretto a café serré.

  <p>Doppio espresso is a double shot which is extracted using double the amount of ground coffee in a larger-sized portafilter basket. This results in 60 ml of drink, double the amount of a single shot espresso. Doppio is Italian multiplier, meaning 'double'. It is commonly called a standard double, due to its standard in judging the espresso quality in barista competitions, where four single espresso are made using two double portafilters.</p>

        <p>An espresso romano is a shot of espresso with a slice of lemon served on the side. The lemon can be run along the rim of the cup as a way to accentuate the espresso's sweetness. Despite the name, it has no link to Italy nor Rome. An espresso Sara originates from the municipality of Budoia in Northern Italy
Despite this simplicity, however, there is still some confusion surrounding the drink. For starters, it goes by a different name in different parts of the world, and particular regions of Italy.

Furthermore, while the word “romano” is present in the beverage’s name, there is no definitive evidence that it has an historic link to either Rome or Italy.

          Caffè latte , often shortened to just latte in English, is a coffee drink of Italian origin made with espresso and steamed milk, traditionally served in a glass. Variants include the chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another beverage base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; alternatives to milk, such as soy milk, almond milk or oat milk, are also used.

        <p>Latte macchiato  is a coffee beverage. The name is Italian for 'stained milk' or 'marked milk', referring to the way the drink is prepared by pouring a shot of espresso into steamed milk. It is a play on espresso macchiato, an older drink consisting of espresso marked with a dollop or two of milk or cream.</p>
